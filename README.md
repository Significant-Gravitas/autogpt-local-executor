# ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL — AutoGPT Local PC Executor

> **DANGER: experimental software that can read and write local files and,
> when explicitly enabled, execute unrestricted user-level shell commands on
> instruction from a cloud LLM.** Do not run on any machine you care about.
> Do not run as root. `--allowed-root` protects `FILE_*` operations only; it
> does not sandbox the shell.

## What Is This?

A daemon you install on your local machine that connects it to the [AutoGPT hosted platform](https://platform.autogpt.net) as an execution backend — instead of an E2B cloud sandbox.

Once connected, AutoGPT can:
- Read and write files on your filesystem (jailed to the folder selected for that chat)
- *(Optional, disabled by default)* Execute shell commands as your user
  (per-OS shell selection — bash/zsh/pwsh/cmd)
- *(Optional)* Take screenshots and control mouse/keyboard via Claude's computer use API
- *(Optional)* Access local hardware (serial, USB, GPIO)
- *(Optional)* Route LLM inference to a local Ollama instance

Cross-platform: macOS, Windows, Linux (Tier 1); WSL2 + Windows-on-ARM
(Tier 2). See [CROSS_PLATFORM.md](docs/CROSS_PLATFORM.md) for the
support matrix.

## Platform Binding Layer

The platform-side code (WebSocket route, `LocalPCShim`, `ShimConnectionManager`, config hooks) lives in the AutoGPT monorepo:
👉 https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/pull/13050

## Install (alpha)

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/autogpt-local-executor.git

# One-time: OAuth to your platform deployment.
autogpt-shim auth

# Keep the paired machine online. This opens an outbound control connection;
# the platform's new-chat flow lets you browse and select a folder per chat.
autogpt-shim start

# High-risk capabilities are explicit start-command opt-ins:
autogpt-shim start --enable-shell

# Compatibility only: connect directly to one pre-existing copilot session.
# In this legacy mode --allowed-root remains the one session's file jail.
autogpt-shim \
  --allowed-root ~/autogpt-workspace \
  start --session-id "<copilot-session-id>"

# --enable-recording is reserved for the design preview. The daemon currently
# refuses this flag with EX_CONFIG because capture + interpretation aren't yet
# safe to expose end to end.
```

For autostart, run `autogpt-shim install`, enable the generated per-user service,
and omit `session_id` from the TOML configuration. The service maintains the
persistent paired-machine connection; selected roots are isolated per chat.

The platform never sends an arbitrary host path to the shim. Folder navigation
uses short-lived opaque references issued by the host, and selecting a folder
produces a machine-signed root grant that can restore that chat after a daemon
restart. Folder names and canonical paths are visible to the paired platform
during browsing; file names, file content, sizes, timestamps, and permissions
are not returned by this control API.

The daemon also fails startup if its tamper-evident audit writer cannot be
initialized; there is no implicit unaudited mode.

Then on the platform: ask an operator to flip the `local-pc-executor`
LaunchDarkly flag for your user. Once on, copilot turns route through
your shim instead of E2B. Audit log lives at the per-OS path documented
in [AUDIT_LOG.md](docs/AUDIT_LOG.md); review it with
`autogpt-shim audit tail` / `verify`.

### Recording design preview (disabled)

Recording protocol and macOS capture code exist for design/testing, but the
capture-to-interpretation path is incomplete. The daemon never advertises the
capability, and setting `enable_recording=true` or passing `--enable-recording`
fails startup clearly. The intended trust boundary below remains design
documentation, not a currently enabled product promise.
