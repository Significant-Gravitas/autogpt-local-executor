"""
WindowRegistry — UUID-to-native-handle map with re-verify-at-USE.

Per docs/COMPUTER_USE.md Q2: window_id is a shim-minted opaque UUID with
a `win_` prefix, never reused, wiped on every HELLO. The registry
records a fingerprint `(pid, class_name, creation_timestamp)` at LIST
time and checks it again at USE time. Mismatch → WindowStaleError; the
shim never silently re-binds.

The registry is OS-agnostic — backends supply their own
NativeWindowHandle subclass and `fingerprint()` helper.
