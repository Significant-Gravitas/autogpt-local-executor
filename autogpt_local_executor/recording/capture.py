Capture sources — the OS-specific seam, behind one interface.

`CaptureSource` is THE seam. Everything downstream (RecordingSession, the
handler, the wire) consumes `TrajectoryStep`s from an async iterator and never
knows whether they came from a real OS input hook, a screenshot floor, or a
scripted test list.

WHERE THE REAL OS-HOOK AUTHOR PLUGS IN
--------------------------------------
The genuinely OS-specific part — observing the user's *input* (the click/keys
that mark "a step happened") — CANNOT be validated in this environment and is
NOT built here. It is itself a `CaptureSource`:

    `ScreenshotActionFloor(input_events=<real OS input-hook CaptureSource>)`

The floor consumes a stream of *input-event* steps from its injected
`input_events` source and, for each, snapshots the pre-action frame + cursor +
active app/window to fill the floor fields. To land real per-OS capture, write
a `CaptureSource` whose `steps()` yields one step per observed user action
(macOS `CGEventTap`, Windows `SetWindowsHookEx`, Linux X11 `XRecord`) and pass
it as `input_events`. No other layer changes. The `MockCaptureSource` is the
reference shape for that producer.

Browser DOM enrichment is NOT built here: it arrives from the platform/extension
side (the claude-in-chrome channel) as already-`dom`-kind steps on the wire;
the shim just accepts them.

    itself an injected `CaptureSource` (`input_events`) — that is the per-OS
    seam. For each input-event step the producer yields, the floor:

      * mints a screenshot stub id (the real frame is buffered out-of-band; the
        wire carries only the stub ref, never inline bytes — §1);

        A11yEnricher / browser channel's job).

    permission), the step still flows with its producer-supplied fields and a
