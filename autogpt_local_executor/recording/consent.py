"""
Consent tokens — shim-enforced, not platform-asserted (§9).

`START_RECORDING` carries a `consent_token` the shim issues *only* after an
OS-native, shim-rendered confirmation the platform cannot script. A platform
that sends START without a valid token gets CONSENT_REQUIRED.

Design (per docs/WORKFLOW_RECORDING.md §9):

- The token is minted **only** by a shim-local call (`issue_consent_token`),
  simulating the OS-native confirmation. The platform can never mint one — it
  has no access to the shim-local HMAC key and never sees the issuance path.
- `validate_consent_token` checks the signature, expiry, and single-use status.
  A token is consumed on the first successful START so it can't be replayed.
- `request_user_consent()` is the seam for the real OS-native dialog. For now
  it is a stub that issues a token directly (see the TODO). The real
  implementation MUST show a tray/menu-bar dialog the platform-controlled UI
  cannot drive, gather an affirmative click, and only then mint.

The token is intentionally opaque to the platform: it round-trips it verbatim.
