"""
Interpretation-route probing — detect local capability, only then ask (§3.1).

On START_RECORDING the shim probes, in order:

  1. a11y / DOM already captured for the demonstrated steps → free structured
     text → `extract_then_cloud` works.
  2. OCR available on-device → `extract_then_cloud` works even for `kind: none`
     (canvas/Electron) steps.
  3. Capable local vision model present → offer `local_vlm` (zero cloud).
  4. None of the above → `screenshots_to_cloud`, the ONLY route that prompts
     the user (§9.1).

Each probe is a small checker. The VLM/OCR probes are capability checks — is
the dependency importable, is a model listed — they do NOT actually run a
model. Matching the prompt to the actual incremental risk is deliberate (§3.1):
only `screenshots_to_cloud` requires consent.
