# OAuth Flow — Shim Authentication

> **Status**: Implemented

The shim authenticates using AutoGPT's **existing OAuth 2.0 provider infrastructure** —
the same system used by third-party app integrations. No new auth infrastructure needed.

## Why Not Device OAuth?

AutoGPT already runs a full OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server:
- `/auth/authorize` — authorization endpoint
- `/api/oauth/token` — token endpoint
- `introspect_token()` — token validation
- Authorization Code + PKCE flow already implemented

Device OAuth would be redundant. The shim registers as an OAuth app and uses
Authorization Code + PKCE with a localhost redirect URI.

---

## Registration (One-Time)

The shim is a first-party public OAuth application registered in the AutoGPT
platform. It uses Authorization Code + PKCE and has no client secret.

```
Client ID:     autogpt-local-executor (well-known)
Client type:   public (PKCE; no client secret)
Redirect URI:  http://localhost:{port}/callback   where {port} ∈ 41899..41910
Scopes:        USE_TOOLS
Grant types:   authorization_code, refresh_token
```

Ports 41899–41910 (12 ports) are reserved for the shim's local callback
server. The shim binds the first free port in that range, so a busy 41899
(held by another app, a stale shim process, or a developer's local dev
server) doesn't break first-time auth. The platform's OAuth client
registration MUST accept all ports in this range as valid `redirect_uri`
values for `client_id=autogpt-local-executor` — registering only 41899
would defeat the fallback. Listener is always bound to `127.0.0.1`; never
to `0.0.0.0`. See [CROSS_PLATFORM.md → OAuth callback port](CROSS_PLATFORM.md#oauth-callback-port).

### Operator setup (per-environment)

Each platform deployment registers the app once via the existing
`oauth-tool` CLI inside the backend container:

```bash
poetry run oauth-tool generate-app \
    --name "AutoGPT Local Executor" \
    --client-id "autogpt-local-executor" \
    --public \
    --description "Local PC shim for the AutoGPT hosted platform" \
    --redirect-uris \
      "http://localhost:41899/callback,http://localhost:41900/callback,\
http://localhost:41901/callback,http://localhost:41902/callback,\
http://localhost:41903/callback,http://localhost:41904/callback,\
http://localhost:41905/callback,http://localhost:41906/callback,\
http://localhost:41907/callback,http://localhost:41908/callback,\
http://localhost:41909/callback,http://localhost:41910/callback" \
    --scopes "USE_TOOLS"
```

The command prints SQL containing the well-known public client ID and an
`isPublic=true` marker. Replace `YOUR_USER_ID_HERE`, execute it once per
environment, and keep every callback URI in the registration. Self-hosters
that choose another ID configure it with `AUTOGPT_SHIM_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`.

### True public-client support (implemented)

`OAuthApplication.isPublic` (added in migration
`20260604120000_add_oauth_application_is_public`) and the
`validate_client_credentials(..., code_verifier=...)` short-circuit
together implement the OAuth 2.1 best-practice for desktop / mobile /
SPA clients (PKCE, no client_secret).

- Confidential client (default, `isPublic=false`): `client_secret` is
  required as before. No behavior change.
- Public client (`isPublic=true`): `client_secret` is ignored;
  `code_verifier` is required and is the only credential. The PKCE
  challenge/verifier check still happens in `consume_authorization_code`
  (which compares the verifier against the stored code_challenge).

The `oauth-tool generate-app --public` command sets this field for new shim
registrations. Existing registrations can be migrated with `UPDATE
"OAuthApplication" SET "isPublic" = true WHERE "clientId" = '<id>'`.

Introspect (`/api/oauth/introspect`) remains confidential-auth-only. Revoke
(`/api/oauth/revoke`) accepts this registered public client without a secret,
binds each token to the client before revoking it, and returns the RFC 7009
non-disclosing success response. `autogpt-shim revoke` revokes the access and
refresh tokens before clearing the keychain. The platform also pushes a
`SESSION_REVOKED` frame to a connected shim (see `PROTOCOL.md`).

## WebSocket Connection Auth

On every WebSocket connect, the shim includes the access token:

```
GET /ws/local-executor                 # persistent machine control
GET /ws/local-executor/{session_id}    # activated per-chat data channel
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

Platform validates via `introspect_token(access_token)`:
- Checks token not expired
- On data channels, checks token belongs to the session owner
- On the control channel, registers the online machine under the token's user
- Checks `USE_TOOLS` scope present
- Returns user_id for the session

---

## Token Refresh

The shim refreshes using the stored `refresh_token` exactly once when the
initial WebSocket upgrade returns 401. An initial 403 is treated as a terminal
session-authorization denial and never rotates credentials. If the post-refresh
retry returns 401 or 403, startup terminates instead of entering the reconnect
loop. The refresh is forced even while the rejected access token remains in the
keychain.
- On refresh failure (expired refresh token), prompt user to re-auth via CLI: `autogpt-shim auth`

Tokens stored in OS keychain:
- macOS: Keychain Services via `keyring` library
- Linux: Secret Service (GNOME Keyring / KWallet) via `keyring`
- Windows: Windows Credential Manager via `keyring`

---

## Scope

The public shim client requests `USE_TOOLS`, an existing AutoGPT
`APIKeyPermission`. The WebSocket handshake requires that scope in addition to
an active access token and session ownership. Individual executor capabilities
remain opt-in through shim configuration, HELLO capability advertisement,
platform feature flags, and the per-session computer-use consent gate.
